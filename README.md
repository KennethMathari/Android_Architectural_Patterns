# Android MVC Architectural Pattern
This app demonstrates the use of MVC architectural pattern in android. It also shows how to perform unit testing on the MVC architectural pattern.
In this pattern, three components with distinct responsibilities are defined as follows:
<ul>
<li><b>Model</b> is the data layer. This includes the data objects, database classes, and other business logic, concerned with storing the data, retrieving the data, updating the data, etc.</li>
<li><b>View</b> renders the data using the Model in a way suitable for user interface. It is what gets displayed to the user.</li>
<li><b>Controller</b> is the brains of the system. It encapsulates the logic of the system, and it controls both the Model and View. The user interacts with the system through this controller.</li>
</ul>

<p>Here how the MVC pattern is adapted in Android:</p>
